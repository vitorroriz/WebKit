// Understanding Stop the World (STW)
// ==================================
//
// Intuition on how to think about things?
// =======================================
// The actors in play for a Stop the World story are:
// 1. VMManager
// 2. VM
// 3. a Conductor Agent
//
// Events / actions involved in the Stop the World story are:
// 1. Stop requests (with a given StopReason)
// 2. Stop callback handlers
//
// An intuitive way to think about the Stop the World story is:
//
// 1. VMManager is an abstraction representing the process. There is only 1 singleton
//    VMManager instance, and it coordinates the tracking and scheduling of VMs.
//
// 2. VM (and its VMThreadContext) represents a thread. A VM instance may actually
//    run on different machine threads at different times (JSC's API allows this).
//    However, from VMManager's perspective, each VM is like a thread that can be
//    suspended / stopped, and resumed.
//
//    FIXME: the current VMManager does NOT yet handle cases where more than one VM
//    is run on the same machine thread e.g. one VM1 calls into C++, which in turn
//    calls into VM2. VM2 now has control of the CPU, but VMManager does not know
//    that VM1 is in a way "deactivated". This scenario cannot manifest in WebKit
//    with web workloads though.
//
// 3. The Conductor Agent is something like a Debugger agent that tells VMManager
//    to stop or resume VMs / threads.
//
// 4. Stop requests are like interrupts. A stop being requested is analogous to an
//    interrupt firing.
//
// 5. Stop callback handlers are like interrupt handlers that masked out all interrupts
//    so that no other interrupts can fire while the current one is being handled.
//
//    When a stop request occurs, VMManager::notifyVMStop() will dispatch a callback
//    to the appropriate handler for that request. Similar to the interrupt
//    analogy, only one request can be serviced at one time. All other requests
//    regardless of priority will be blocked (and held in pending) until the current
//    request is done being serviced.
//
// World Execution Modes
// =====================
// The VMManager has a notion of a world mode (see VMManager::Mode). These modes are:
// 1. RunAll - all threads can run or are running.
// 2. RunOne - only one thread can run, like when a debugger is single stepping.
// 3. Stopping - a stop has been requested, and VMs are in the process of stopping.
// 4. Stopped - all threads have been stopped, and the highest priority stop request
//              can now be serviced.
//
// Querying VMManager Info
// =======================
// VMManager::info() provides a view into a few pieces of VMManager state:
// 1. numberOfVMs - the number of VMs that have been constructed and are alive.
// 2. numberOfActiveVMs - the number of VMs that are activated i.e. their threads
//        have entered the VM. This numberOfActiveVMs is only available while the
//        world is NOT in Mode::RunAll (i.e. must be in some form of stoppage).
// 3. numberOfStoppedVMs - the number of VMs that have reached the stopping point
//        in VMManager::notifyVMStop(). The currently executing targetVM is counted
//        as stopped when single stepping in Mode::RunOne.
// 3. worldMode - this is the current VM world mode (as described above).
//
// Currently, this info is mainly used for testing purposes only.
//
// Initiating Stop the World
// =========================
// Stop the World begins with some agent calling VMManager::requestStopAll() with a
// StopReason. This agent can be from mutator threads or from a helper thread like
// those employed by debuggers.
//
// More than one agent can request STW at the same time. Hence, there can be multiple
// stop requests queued up while the world is being stopped.
//
// StopReason and their Priority
// =============================
// Current StopReasons are:
//     None - no requests
//     GC - requesting stop for Global GC
//     WasmDebugger - requesting stop for Wasm Debugger (like Ctrl-C in lldb)
//     MemoryDebugger - similar to WasmDebugger, but for the Memory Debugger.
//
// The priority of these requests are defined by their order of declaration.
// See definition of FOR_EACH_STOP_THE_WORLD_REASON and enum class StopReason.
// StopReason::None is a special case and has no priority.
// StopReason::GC is the current highest priority request.
// StopReason::MemoryDebugger is the current lowest priority request.
//
// StopReason is synonymous with "StopRequest".
// From the client's perspective, it is the reason for a stop request.
// From the VMManager's perspective, it is the type of stop request.
//
// Servicing Order: one request at a time
// ======================================
// The order the stop requests came in does not matter. Once the world is finally
// stopped, the higher priority request is serviced first.
// See fetchTopPriorityStopReason() and m_currentStopReason.
//
// While this request is being serviced, other requests will be ignored. During
// this time of service, new stop requests can be added to m_pendingStopRequestBits,
// but they will be ignored even if they are higher priority. We will service them
// only after the current request has resumed with RunOne or RunAll mode.
//
// StopTheWorldCallback (i.e. stop request handlers)
// =================================================
// When the world is stopped, VMManager will call back to a request handler
// based on what StopReason is in m_currentStopReason. See VMManager::notifyVMStop().
//
// The handler for GC should be static but is not currently implemented yet.
// The handlers for WasmDebugger and MemoryDebugger may be overridden. They are
// made to be overrideable only to enable testing. See VMManagerStopTheWorldTest.cpp
// for how they are used in testing.
//
// Each handler must be of the shape StopTheWorldCallback. See StopTheWorldCallback.h
// The handler will be called with a StopTheWorldEvent. The StopTheWorldEvent indicates
// where the handler is called from. This may have a use later on, but for now, the
// StopTheWorldEvent is only informational.
//
// After the handler is done, it controls how execution will proceed thereafter by
// returning one of the StopTheWorldCallback return values (see StopTheWorldCallback.h).
// The possible return values are:
//
// 1. STW_CONTINUE()
//    - this is only used for testing purposes where we want to loop inside
//      VMManager::notifyVMStop() while waiting for more things to handle.
//    - VMManager::m_worldMode will remain in Mode::Stopped.
// 2. STW_CONTEXT_SWITCH(targetVM)
//    - this is used to switch control of the handler to another VM on a different
//      thread without resuming any execution. lldb's  "thread select ..." can be
//      implemented this way.
//    - VMManager::m_worldMode will remain in Mode::Stopped.
// 3. STW_RESUME_ONE()
//    - this is used to resume only the current VM thread in RunOne mode. This is
//      useful for debuggers that wish to single step in the current VM. It keeps
//      other threads paused / stopped while this thread executes. It is up to the
//      client to detect potential resource deadlocks (e.g. using a timeout) that
//      may arise from only resuming 1 thread.
//    - VMManager::m_worldMode will transition from Mode::Stopped to Mode::RunOne.
// 4. STW_RESUME_ALL()
//    - forces all threads to resume from a stop.
//    - VMManager::m_worldMode will transition from Mode::Stopped to Mode::RunAll.
// 5. STW_RESUME()
//    - Return to whatever run mode we were executing with before the current Stop
//      the World request. That may be either Mode::RunOne or Mode::RunAll.
//    - This allows the GC to run (with its own Stop the World requests) even while
//      while we're single stepping in a debugger with Mode::RunOne.
//
// Edge Cases and Special Circumstances
// ====================================
// While in Mode::RunOne, if the VM that is running either exits the VM (aka
// deactivates) or its VM is destructed (aka shutdown), the VMManager will transition
// the world mode back to RunAll (unblocking other VMs and threads)  since the current
// VM is no longer viable for continuing execution.
