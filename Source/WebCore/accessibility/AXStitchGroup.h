// This class represents a stitch-group. All members in a stitch-group will not
// be exposed in the outwardly facing accessibility tree except for the group
// representative (m_representativeID), who will respond to accessibility APIs
// using the stitched representation of all members of the group.
//
// The intention of this is to expose a simpler accessibility tree, making
// the job of assistive technologies easier, and the lives of users better, e.g.
// by reducing the number of navigation stops an AT user has to make.
//
// Stitch groups are per-block-flow element, so only nodes within the same flow
// can be stitched together. Stitch group membership is maintained by the
// AXObjectCache on the main-thread, and stored as an AXProperty on each block-flow
// AXIsolatedObject on the accessibility thread. A stitch group is only valid if it
// has 2 or more elements within it — a group of one makes no sense.
