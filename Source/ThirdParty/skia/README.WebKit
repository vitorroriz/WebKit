The simplest way of updating its contents is to re-create the directory
from scratch, and restoring the needed files with Git. Example commands:

  rm -rf Source/ThirdParty/skia
  cp -ar ../path/to/skia Source/ThirdParty/
  rm -rf Source/ThirdParty/skia/.git/
  git checkout -- \
      Source/ThirdParty/skia/README.WebKit \
      Source/ThirdParty/skia/CMakeLists.txt
  git add -A Source/ThirdParty/skia/

Then check whether the updated sources require any changes to the CMake
build system, and update the Skia commit identifier in this file.
