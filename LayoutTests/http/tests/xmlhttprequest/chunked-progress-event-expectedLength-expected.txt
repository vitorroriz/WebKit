Test case for bug 36156: XHR 'progress' event code assumes wrongly that expectedLength >= 0

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Verify that the progress event total property is 0 when the expected overall length can't be computed.
PASS Length is not computable
PASS gotRelevantProgressEvent is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
