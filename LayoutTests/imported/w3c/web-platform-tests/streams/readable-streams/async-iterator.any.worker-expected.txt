FAIL next() rejects if the stream errors promise_rejects_exactly: 2nd next() function "function() { throw e; }" threw object "TypeError: Type error" but we expected it to throw object "Error: error1"
PASS return() does not rejects if the stream has not errored yet
PASS return() rejects if the stream has errored
