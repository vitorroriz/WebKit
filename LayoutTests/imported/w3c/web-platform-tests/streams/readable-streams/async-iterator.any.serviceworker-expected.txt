Harness Error (FAIL), message = Unhandled rejection: Type error

FAIL Async iterator instances should have the correct list of properties assert_array_equals: should have all the correct methods lengths differ, expected array ["next", "return"] length 2, got ["next"] length 1
PASS Async-iterating a push source
PASS Async-iterating a pull source
FAIL Async-iterating a push source with undefined values assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [undefined, undefined, undefined] length 3, got [] length 0
FAIL Async-iterating a pull source with undefined values assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [undefined, undefined, undefined] length 3, got [] length 0

FAIL Async-iterating an errored stream throws assert_equals: expected (string) "e" but got (object) object "TypeError: Type error"
PASS Async-iterating a closed stream never executes the loop body, but works fine
PASS Async-iterating an empty but not closed/errored stream never executes the loop body and stalls the async function
